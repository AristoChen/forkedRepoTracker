# forkedRepoTracker

### Origin
I was finding some useful resources in github recently, but after tested some awesome repo, I found out that those repo were not fully suitable in my case. Fortunately there are dozens of fork for that repo, so I decided to write a crawler to get all the ahead commits, maybe some of them will solve my problem or give me some idea

### To do
* If the amount of forked repo is too much, we can only get 996 repos currently
